    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive guide designed to introduce you to the world of SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC), Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (COGs), and the eoAPI. Tailored for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), this Jupyter Notebook aims to provide you with the foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary to effectively utilize these powerful tools in geospatial data management and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook delves into the essentials of using eoAPI, offering insights into STAC and COGs. We will explore how eoAPI facilitates querying metadata and visualizing the underlying referenced data. All notebooks of the repository run within a specially configured cluster, integrating a deployed instance of eoAPI and JupyterHub to provide a seamless, hands-on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also cover the types of data integrated into this system and discuss the methodologies employed for data addition, setting the stage for a deep dive into the practical applications of these technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STAC, COG, and eoAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STAC**: We begin with an introduction to STAC, explaining its structure and critical role in damage assessment and risk management.\n",
    "- **COG**: Next, we explore COGs and why they are pivotal in modern geospatial data handling.\n",
    "- **eoAPI**: Finally, we discuss eoAPI, detailing its functionalities and importance in this ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the foundational guide for the IFRC's of eoAPI and associated resources. It is structured to guide you through these concepts, culminating in a hands-on demonstration of using eoAPI to query and visualize earth observation data."

    "### What is STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) is a specification designed to standardize how geospatial data is organized and accessed. It's a community-driven standard developed collaboratively by experts and stakeholders in the geospatial data field. STAC provides a common language and structure for describing geospatial information, making it easier to index, discover, and manage spatial data across various platforms and systems. One of the critical features of STAC is its format: simple JSON objects, which are both human-readable and machine-processable, ensuring ease of use and broad accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is STAC Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "STAC is critical in the modern earth observation stack, particularly for large-scale environmental monitoring, disaster response, and risk assessment scenarios. Its standardized, community-backed approach facilitates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Data Discovery**: Simplifying the finding of relevant geospatial data across vast datasets.\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Enabling different systems and tools to access and use geospatial data seamlessly.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Supporting the management of increasingly large and complex datasets is a common challenge in geospatial analysis.\n",
    "- **Inclusivity and Collaboration**: STAC evolves through collective insights as a community-driven standard, ensuring it remains relevant and effective for various use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For organizations like the IFRC, STAC's capabilities are invaluable in rapidly accessing and analyzing data for humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and risk management purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Can I Learn More?\n",
    "\n",
    "To deepen your understanding of STAC and its applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STAC Specification**: Dive into the official [STAC Specification](https://stacspec.org/) for detailed documentation and standards.\n",
    "- **STAC Index**: Explore the [STAC Index](https://stacindex.org/), a comprehensive resource listing STAC implementations, tools, and data catalogs, to get a better grasp of the ecosystem and its applications.\n",
    "- **Developer Best Practices**: For a more technical perspective, review the [STAC Best Practices](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/best-practices.md) on GitHub, offering in-depth guidance for developers working with STAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress through this notebook, we'll explore applying STAC principles using eoAPI in practical scenarios."

    "## COG: What is it? Why is it important? How can I learn more?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a COG (Cloud Optimized Geotiff)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a variant of the TIFF image format tailored explicitly for optimized access over a network. A raster format specifies a particular layout of internal data within the GeoTIFF specification, allowing for efficient, subsetted, or aggregated access. This format is designed to enable efficient workflows on the cloud by leveraging HTTP GET range requests for just the parts of the file needed. COGs are regular GeoTIFF files, making them backward compatible with other geospatial software but with an internal organization that enables more efficient data access and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is COG Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "COGs represent a significant advancement in geospatial data handling, primarily due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Imagery Data Access**: COG-aware software can stream just the portion of data it needs, significantly improving processing times and enabling real-time workflows that were previously not possible.\n",
    "- **Internal Compression and Optimized Read Performance**: COGs are internally compressed, meaning the inner blocks in a GeoTIFF are already compressed. This internal compression allows COG readers to decompress only the specific portion of the file requested rather than the entire file.\n",
    "- **Reduced Duplication of Data**: COGs enable diverse software to access a single file online, reducing the need to copy and cache data.\n",
    "- **Legacy Compatibility**: Traditional GIS software can treat cloud-optimized geoTIFFs just like normal geoTIFFs, simplifying data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Can I Learn More?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper dive into COGs and to understand their implementation and usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Official Documentation**: Visit the [COG website](https://www.cogeo.org/) for a comprehensive understanding of COGs and their implementation details.\n",
    "- **Cloud Native Geospatial Formats Guide**: The [Cloud Native Geospatial Formats Guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/) offers detailed insights into COGs, including advanced details and working examples to help you grasp the practical applications of this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we'll explore the practical application of COGs in conjunction with eoAPI, focusing on how they can be utilized for efficient geospatial data management and visualization."
