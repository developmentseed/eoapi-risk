    "## A Foundational Guide for the IFRC's Geospatial Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive guide designed to introduce you to the world of SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC), Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (COGs), and the eoAPI. Tailored for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), this Jupyter Notebook aims to provide you with the foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary to effectively utilize these powerful tools in geospatial data management and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook delves into the essentials of using eoAPI, offering insights into STAC and COGs. We will explore how eoAPI facilitates querying metadata and visualizing the underlying referenced data. All notebooks of the repository run within a specially configured cluster, integrating a deployed instance of eoAPI and JupyterHub to provide a seamless, hands-on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also cover the types of data integrated into this system and discuss the methodologies employed for data addition, setting the stage for a deep dive into the practical applications of these technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STAC, COG, and eoAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STAC**: We begin with an introduction to STAC, explaining its structure and critical role in damage assessment and risk management.\n",
    "- **COG**: Next, we explore COGs and why they are pivotal in modern geospatial data handling.\n",
    "- **eoAPI**: Finally, we discuss eoAPI, detailing its functionalities and importance in this ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the foundational guide for the IFRC's of eoAPI and associated resources. It is structured to guide you through these concepts, culminating in a hands-on demonstration of using eoAPI to query and visualize earth observation data."
