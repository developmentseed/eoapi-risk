    "\n",
    "### What is STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) is a specification designed to standardize how geospatial data is organized and accessed. It's a community-driven standard developed collaboratively by experts and stakeholders in the geospatial data field. STAC provides a common language and structure for describing geospatial information, making it easier to index, discover, and manage spatial data across various platforms and systems. One of the critical features of STAC is its format: simple JSON objects, which are both human-readable and machine-processable, ensuring ease of use and broad accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental aspect of STAC's design is its hierarchical organization, comprising Catalogs, Collections, and Items. At the highest level, **Catalogs** serve as containers that organize and provide access to Collections and Items. **Collections** represent a group of Items that share common properties, metadata, and structure, typically representing a dataset or a series of datasets. Within Collections, **Items** are individual pieces of data, each containing specific geospatial information, such as location and time. Crucially, each Item includes links to its Assets, which are the files associated with the data, such as imagery, thumbnails, or other related resources. These **Assets** are integral to the utility of each Item, providing the data required for analysis and visualization. This structured approach ensures a consistent and intuitive way to access and manage vast amounts of geospatial data, making STAC an efficient tool for data providers and users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is STAC Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "STAC is critical in the modern earth observation stack, particularly for large-scale environmental monitoring, disaster response, and risk assessment scenarios. Its standardized, community-backed approach facilitates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Data Discovery**: Simplifying the finding of relevant geospatial data across vast datasets.\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Enabling different systems and tools to access and use geospatial data seamlessly.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Supporting the management of increasingly large and complex datasets is a common challenge in geospatial analysis.\n",
    "- **Inclusivity and Collaboration**: STAC evolves through collective insights as a community-driven standard, ensuring it remains relevant and effective for various use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For organizations like the IFRC, STAC's capabilities are invaluable in rapidly accessing and analyzing data for humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and risk management purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Can I Learn More?\n",
    "\n",
    "To deepen your understanding of STAC and its applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STAC Specification**: Dive into the official [STAC Specification](https://stacspec.org/) for detailed documentation and standards.\n",
    "- **STAC Index**: Explore the [STAC Index](https://stacindex.org/), a comprehensive resource listing STAC implementations, tools, and data catalogs, to get a better grasp of the ecosystem and its applications.\n",
    "- **Developer Best Practices**: For a more technical perspective, review the [STAC Best Practices](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/best-practices.md) on GitHub, offering in-depth guidance for developers working with STAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress through this notebook, we'll explore applying STAC principles using eoAPI in practical scenarios."

    "## COG: What is it? Why is it important? How can I learn more?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a COG (Cloud Optimized Geotiff)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a variant of the TIFF image format tailored explicitly for optimized access over a network. A raster format specifies a particular layout of internal data within the GeoTIFF specification, allowing for efficient, subsetted, or aggregated access. This format is designed to enable efficient workflows on the cloud by leveraging HTTP GET range requests for just the parts of the file needed. COGs are regular GeoTIFF files, making them backward compatible with other geospatial software but with an internal organization that enables more efficient data access and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is COG Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "COGs represent a significant advancement in geospatial data handling, primarily due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Imagery Data Access**: COG-aware software can stream just the portion of data it needs, significantly improving processing times and enabling real-time workflows that were previously not possible.\n",
    "- **Internal Compression and Optimized Read Performance**: COGs are internally compressed, meaning the inner blocks in a GeoTIFF are already compressed. This internal compression allows COG readers to decompress only the specific portion of the file requested rather than the entire file.\n",
    "- **Reduced Duplication of Data**: COGs enable diverse software to access a single file online, reducing the need to copy and cache data.\n",
    "- **Legacy Compatibility**: Traditional GIS software can treat cloud-optimized geoTIFFs just like normal geoTIFFs, simplifying data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Can I Learn More?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper dive into COGs and to understand their implementation and usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Official Documentation**: Visit the [COG website](https://www.cogeo.org/) for a comprehensive understanding of COGs and their implementation details.\n",
    "- **Cloud Native Geospatial Formats Guide**: The [Cloud Native Geospatial Formats Guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/) offers detailed insights into COGs, including advanced details and working examples to help you grasp the practical applications of this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we'll explore the practical application of COGs in conjunction with eoAPI, focusing on how they can be utilized for efficient geospatial data management and visualization."

    "\n",
    "### What is eoAPI?\n",
    "\n",
    "eoAPI is an open-source framework for accessing and utilizing Earth Observation (EO) data. It simplifies constructing a cloud-native EO infrastructure by providing sensible defaults for most EO and geospatial infrastructure needs. eoAPI is modular, allowing for easy customization to specific requirements. Its key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STAC Powered**: Utilizes a suite of STAC-focused technologies.\n",
    "- **Sensible Defaults**: Facilitates seamless deployment, configuration, and customization.\n",
    "- **Cloud Agnostic**: Capable of quick deployment and scaling of EO services anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is eoAPI Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "eoAPI addresses the challenge of making EO data easily discoverable, interoperable, ingestible, and optimized for integration into modern applications and decision-making tools. Simply put, it lowers the barrier of entry to earth observation data to a broader range of developers, scientists, and the general public. This is crucial for understanding our changing planet and maximizing the societal impact of EO data. eoAPI's framework supports end-to-end EO infrastructure, including data cataloging, searching, visualization, and access, making it a powerful tool for organizations like the IFRC in their mission-driven work.\n",
